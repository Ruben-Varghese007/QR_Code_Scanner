# QR Code Scanner

This project is a real-time QR Code Scanner built using OpenCV, PyZbar, and Streamlit. 
The application reads QR codes through your webcam and checks if the decoded data matches any authorized entries in a predefined list. 
The application will continuously display the status of the scanned QR code as either "Authorized" or "Un-Authorized" based on the data.

## Run the OpenCV application:
python QRCodeProject.py
## OR
standard F5 or Run program

## Run the Streamlit application:
streamlit run app.py
